Connecting your own machine to a Hub someone else already runs. If you are
setting up that Hub, see [running-a-hub.md](running-a-hub.md) instead.

# Spoke setup

*(This is the section for you if someone else already runs a Hub and just
handed you a token, a Hub URL, and a Slack user ID.)*

You can't generate any of these yourself — get them from your Hub operator:

- `CCTAG_HUB_URL` — the Hub's `wss://...` address
- `CCTAG_SPOKE_TOKEN` — a token issued specifically for you
- `CCTAG_OWNER_USER_ID` — your own Slack user ID; must match the ID the
  token was issued for, or the Hub rejects the connection

Your Spoke can use Herdr, Orca, or both: Herdr supports Claude Code and Codex
CLI; Orca supports Claude Code and `omp`, but does not list Codex. If you use
Herdr, install it and register your Claude Code and/or Codex CLI instances as
Herdr agents first — see [Installing Herdr](../README.md#installing-herdr-macos-notes).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TMLlaboratory/cctag.git
cd cctag
npm install
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env   # CCTAG_HUB_URL, CCTAG_SPOKE_TOKEN, CCTAG_OWNER_USER_ID, CCTAG_HERDR_BIN, CCTAG_ORCA_BIN
npm run build
npm run start:spoke   # or dev:spoke while iterating
```

`CCTAG_HERDR_BIN` and `CCTAG_ORCA_BIN` select local CLI paths. When unset, the
defaults are `/opt/homebrew/bin/herdr` and `/opt/homebrew/bin/orca`. A selected
path that does not exist disables that backend; setting its variable to an
empty string disables it explicitly. At least one backend must be available.
Claude Code on Orca has the same cctag features as on Herdr. Orca also supports
`omp` text turns, output, and status; OMP questions and approvals are reported
in Slack but must be answered in the terminal. Codex on Orca is not listed.

Running from a binary install instead of this checkout? Put the same
values at `~/.config/cctag/config.env` (see the config-discovery note under
[Running standalone](../README.md#running-standalone) above) rather than `./.env` —
that path is found from any working directory, so `cctag-spoke` behaves the
same no matter where you launch it from.

The Spoke reconnects automatically (with backoff) if the connection drops.
Pairing state lives locally on your machine
(`~/.cctag/pairings-<hub-url>.json`, namespaced per Hub) — the Hub only
keeps a lightweight, in-memory "which thread belongs to which Spoke" map,
rebuilt from what each Spoke reports on connect.

## Connecting to more than one workspace

If your operator runs more than one Hub (e.g. two Slack workspaces), you
need one Spoke per Hub, each with its own token. Run a second Spoke from
the same checkout by pointing `CCTAG_ENV_FILE` at a per-instance `.env`
instead of duplicating the whole directory — `CCTAG_HUB_URL`,
`CCTAG_SPOKE_TOKEN`, and pairing storage are all kept separate per Hub URL
automatically:

```bash
CCTAG_ENV_FILE=/opt/cctag/.env.workspace2 node dist/spoke/index.js
```

For a persistent second instance, add a second launchd
`LaunchAgent`/systemd unit whose `EnvironmentVariables`/`Environment` sets
`CCTAG_ENV_FILE` to that second `.env` file.

Both Spokes on one machine use the same local Herdr daemon and Orca runtime, so
their pickers can show the same supported sessions. Pairing one workspace to a
terminal does not stop the other workspace's picker from offering it. cctag
doesn't guard against this across separate Spoke processes (only within one
Spoke's own pairings); avoid pairing the same terminal from two workspaces at
once, or writes may be interleaved through Herdr or Orca.

## Troubleshooting: "invalid token"

```
[spoke] disconnected from hub (code 4001: invalid token)
```

This means the Hub you're connecting to doesn't recognize your token —
almost always because it was issued somewhere other than the exact Hub
process you're pointed at (a different machine, or, on a Hub bridging
multiple workspaces, a different workspace's token store — see [Bridging a
second Slack workspace](../README.md#bridging-a-second-slack-workspace)). Ask your
operator to double-check:

- `CCTAG_HUB_URL` in your `.env` matches the Hub they issued the token
  against
- `CCTAG_OWNER_USER_ID` exactly matches the `ownerUserId` the token was
  issued for
- `node dist/hub/index.js token list`, run on the actual Hub machine (with
  the matching `CCTAG_ENV_FILE`, if it bridges more than one workspace),
  shows your name

If it's not listed there, ask them to re-issue it.

## Troubleshooting: `protocol_mismatch` / "インスタンスが見つかりません" after a herdr update

If cctag suddenly can't reach any paired session — the Spoke log fills with

```
{"code":"protocol_mismatch","message":"client protocol N is newer than server protocol M; restart the Herdr server ..."}
```

or every Slack command replies **⚠️ インスタンスが見つかりません** — your local
herdr almost certainly auto-updated underneath a still-running herdr server.
This is a herdr-side issue, not a pairing you need to redo. Fix it in two steps:

**1. Restart the herdr server so client and server run the same version.**
The `herdr` CLI (client) is the freshly-installed binary, but the background
`herdr server` process is still the old one, so they disagree on the wire
protocol. Restarting the server exits pane processes, so save work first:

```bash
herdr server stop      # this closes running panes — expected
herdr                  # starts a fresh server on the new version
```

Then re-register your Claude Code / Codex agents (`herdr agent start ...`, see
[Installing herdr](../README.md#installing-herdr-macos-notes)) and re-run `@cctag connect`
in each thread.

**2. Update cctag if it's from before the herdr 0.7.5 change.**
herdr 0.7.5 (2026-07-21) stopped accepting a `terminal_id` as an agent-command
target — only a pane id resolves now — and removed `herdr agent send`
(`agent send-keys` only takes key *names*, not free text). cctag builds from
before this addressed agents by `terminal_id` and injected text with
`agent send`, so on herdr ≥ 0.7.5 every command fails even after a clean server
restart. Update to the current cctag, which addresses panes by `pane_id` and
submits text with `agent prompt`:

```bash
git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main   # NOT `git pull` — main history was rewritten once
npm install && npm run build
# then restart your Spoke (launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/<your-spoke-label>,
# or just re-run npm run start:spoke)
```

The Hub↔Spoke wire protocol is unchanged across this fix, so a new Spoke and an
old Spoke both work against the same Hub — you can update at your own pace, and
the Hub itself does not need redeploying for this.
