This document explains how cctag works internally (for setup steps, see the [README](../README.md)).

# How cctag works

## 1. What this tool does

**cctag bridges a Slack thread to a coding-agent terminal session running on
your own machine.**

The Herdr backend can submit messages to and read replies from an agent you
are running locally. The optional Orca backend currently discovers and reads
Claude Code terminals but does not send input. Both keep the agent and local
files on your machine; nothing is copied to a sandbox.

How that compares to tools that start a fresh session instead — and where
those are the better choice — is [comparison.md](comparison.md). This document
only explains the mechanism.

This walkthrough uses Claude Code throughout, because the details that are
worth explaining — transcript layout, how a pending question is detected,
Plan Mode — are its own. Herdr supports Claude Code and Codex CLI through
per-pane drivers; Orca currently discovers Claude Code for read-only access.
See the agent support table in the [README](../README.md) for what differs.

```
Slack thread (@cctag)
        ↕
   cctag (Hub / Spoke)
        ↕
   Herdr or Orca (local)
        ↕
   Claude Code (on your PC)
```

## 2. Overall shape: Hub and Spoke

So that multiple people can share a single `@cctag`, cctag splits into two
roles.

| | Role | Runs on | Can do |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hub** | The one connection to Slack | A small always-on server (e.g. a small cloud VM) | Receives Slack messages and forwards them to the right person's Spoke. **Never touches Claude Code or the local terminal backends** |
| **Spoke** | The local terminal connection | **Your own PC** | Lists and reads agents through enabled backends; Herdr also sends input. Orca is read-only in this implementation |

The important part: **the Hub has no way to reach your terminal.** Even if
the Hub's server were compromised, it has no ability to control the Claude
Code running on your machine — only the Spoke running on your own PC can
actually do that. So anyone who wants to control their own PC's Claude Code
from Slack needs to have **their own Spoke running on their own PC**.

## 3. How this relates to herdr: why only "running agents" show up

cctag's Herdr backend talks to
[herdr](https://herdr.dev), whose agent registry narrows the available
panes. Orca is a separate backend with a different discovery path, described
below.

### herdr itself can write to any pane

herdr is fundamentally a tmux-like terminal multiplexer. Commands like
`pane read` (read the screen) and `pane send-keys` (send keystrokes) work
on **any pane herdr manages**, whether Claude Code is running in it or it's
just a plain shell. The in-house bridge that used raw tmux before herdr
(cc-slack-bridge v4) used exactly this raw power — it could send anything
to a hardcoded pane number, for better or worse.

### Only supported agents registered with herdr show up in the "agent list"

What appears in `herdr agent list` (the command cctag uses to build the
`@cctag connect` picker) depends on Herdr's supported agent integrations, not
on every managed pane. Start Claude Code or Codex CLI with `herdr agent start`
and install its matching `herdr integration`; the integration supplies
agent-specific session reporting. Claude Code's `SessionStart` hook reports
its session ID. Codex CLI can appear in the list without one; trusting its
`herdr-agent-state.sh` `SessionStart` hook adds full session-ID reporting, and
cctag otherwise falls back to the paired terminal's working directory.

Plain shells and processes not registered as agents remain visible in
`herdr pane list` but do not appear in `herdr agent list`.

### What makes the Herdr path safe is choosing not to use that raw power

Herdr is just as capable as tmux underneath, but **cctag's Herdr path imposes
its own rule: only ever operate on a `pane_id` that came from `herdr agent
list`/`agent get`.** There's no Slack command that lets you target an
arbitrary pane.

(Before herdr 0.7.5 this was a `terminal_id`. 0.7.5 stopped accepting one as
an agent-command target, hence the move to `pane_id` — which also means a
pairing survives quitting the CLI and restarting it in the same pane.)

Put together:

- **Herdr's agent registry** limits candidates to supported, registered CLI
  agents (Claude Code and Codex CLI), not every managed pane
- **cctag's implementation choice** narrows down what it will actually
  *operate on* (only things discovered via the agent list)

Together, these rules let cctag operate only on supported agents in registered
panes; Herdr's raw pane commands remain capable of addressing arbitrary panes.

### Orca is a separate, read-only backend

When the Orca CLI is available (`CCTAG_ORCA_BIN`, default
`/opt/homebrew/bin/orca`), cctag combines Orca's terminal and worktree
metadata with the local Claude process tree. It joins a process to an Orca
terminal by an exact `tabId:leafId` pane-key match. Only if no direct match
exists may it use the process's `ORCA_TERMINAL_HANDLE`, and only when that
handle names an explicitly orphaned terminal whose `tabId:leafId` pair is
not another pane's ordinary key. Codex is recognized but not listed by this
backend.

This implementation can discover sessions, check whether their terminal is
available, and read the screen. It cannot submit messages or answer prompts
through Orca. Use a Herdr-backed pairing for interactive Slack control.

## 4. From `@cctag connect` to an actual conversation

1. **`@cctag connect`** (owner only) → posts a Slack button menu built from
   the enabled backends: Herdr's Claude Code/Codex agents and Orca's
   read-only Claude Code terminals

   "Owner only" is not simply a narrowed permission. **The Spoke runs on the
   owner's own machine, so `connect` is choosing which of your own panes to
   expose to this thread.** Nobody else can run it because nobody else's panes
   are there — it is less an access rule than the shape of the thing. Once
   paired, anyone in the thread can talk to it (see "What this actually looks
   like in use" in the [README](../README.md)) — so what is restricted is
   *deciding what to attach*, not *using it*.
2. Pick one → that thread (channel + thread_ts) and the backend-qualified
   target (a Herdr pane or `orca:<paneKey>`) are recorded as a pairing

   Orca-backed entries in this implementation support discovery and screen
   reads only. Message submission and prompt answering require Herdr.
3. For a Herdr-backed pairing, sending **`@cctag <message>`**:
   - Submits the text via herdr's `agent prompt`, which sends the text *and*
     the Enter in **one call**. Sending them separately raced Claude Code's
     paste handling: an Enter arriving before the injected text settled got
     absorbed as a newline, leaving the message unsent. `agent prompt`
     sequences both server-side, so there is no such race
   - Polls `agent get` every 1.5s for status (working/blocked/idle/done)
   - Meanwhile reads the Claude Code session's transcript
     (`~/.claude/projects/.../*.jsonl`) incrementally, collecting the
     assistant's reply text
   - **Whether the turn is over is decided from the transcript's own turn
     boundary** (`turn_duration` for Claude Code, the `task_complete` event
     for Codex). herdr's `idle`/`done` alone is not enough: a lingering
     background shell can make it report `working` indefinitely while the
     agent sits idle, and waiting on that never ends. See `src/settle.ts`
   - Once the turn finishes, posts the collected text back to Slack as one
     message

## 5. How multiple-choice prompts (AskUserQuestion, permission menus) work

This is where a real gotcha turned up during development.

**Claude Code does not write an `AskUserQuestion` (multiple-choice
question) to its transcript until after it's answered.** The question and
its answer land together, as a single record, the moment it's answered.
While the question is still on screen, the transcript shows nothing about
it at all.

So detecting a pending question or a pending permission prompt (e.g. "Do
you want to run this tool?") can't use the transcript — it has to **read
the screen itself via `herdr pane read`** and parse the menu with a regex.
A line that reads `N. Type something.` means it's an AskUserQuestion menu;
its absence means it's a permission menu.

There are two ways to answer:

- **Click a button** → sends the matching digit key straight through herdr
  (confirmed on real hardware: a single digit both selects *and* confirms
  — no Enter needed)
- **Reply in the thread with free text** → moves the on-screen cursor down
  to the "Type something" row with the Down arrow key, types the text, and
  presses Enter

## 5.5 Work started without going through Slack

Everything in section 4 ("From `@cctag connect` to an actual conversation")
happens inside a **turn** — cctag only reads the transcript or watches
status while that turn is running.

So what happens if you start a conversation directly at the terminal
(Claude Code app), never touching Slack at all? **Nothing gets posted.**
There's no turn, so there's nothing watching.

That's awkward for a common workflow — start a long task at the terminal,
pair cctag partway through — so `src/watcher.ts`'s **background watcher**
covers this separately. It polls every paired instance with no active turn
roughly every 7 seconds; when one transitions from working to idle/done, it
posts the newly-produced text to the paired thread, prefixed with 🖥️.

To avoid replaying old history, the very first time it sees a pairing
(right after pairing, right after an active turn just finished, or after a
session rotation) it just records the transcript's current end as a
baseline — it only ever reports what happens after that point.

What if that terminal-driven work instead hits an AskUserQuestion or a
permission prompt? Just waiting for `idle`/`done` isn't enough — if no one
answers it, the terminal stays `blocked` forever, and the watcher would
never notice anything (this exact gap surfaced during development and is
what the following fix closes).

So instead of waiting, the moment the watcher sees `blocked` it hands that
terminal off to `TurnEngine.adoptBlockedTerminal()` — putting it on the
**exact same `pollLoop()`** a Slack-initiated turn uses, sending no new
input (the prompt is already on screen). That means the AskUserQuestion/
permission parsing, Slack button posting, button-click and free-text
answering, and "answered directly at the terminal" detection are all the
same existing code, whether the turn started from Slack or was discovered
mid-flight at the terminal. Once handed off, `watcher.ts` stops tracking it
(removed from `this.watches`); when it finishes, `TurnEngine` removes it
from `turns`, and the next poll cycle re-baselines it as a fresh pairing.

## 5.6 Switching model

`@cctag model <name>` (e.g. `model opus`) is handled by a separate path
from a normal conversational turn. It just forwards Claude Code's own slash
command (`/model <name>`) as-is, and isn't treated as a `TurnEngine` turn
(its output doesn't reliably land in the session transcript the way an LLM
reply does).

Instead, `commands.ts`'s `runTuiCommand()`:

1. Sends the slash command via herdr, then confirms it with Enter
2. Polls status; if it goes `blocked` (e.g. the "Switch model? Yes/No"
   confirmation that appears when switching models mid-conversation), the
   existing permission-menu parser (`parsePermissionMenu`) auto-confirms the
   first option — asking for the switch already expressed that intent
3. Once it settles (`idle`/`done`), reads the screen and relays the
   command's own output back to Slack as-is

Step 3's pane read has a gotcha: the TUI's screen always ends with a fixed
footer (a separator, an empty prompt, another separator, then
model/context/cwd/mode status lines). Reading only the last few lines lands
entirely inside that footer, missing the actual command output above it. So
cctag reads a larger chunk and cuts everything from the model/context
status line downward (a distinctive `ctx ... /rc` pattern), then trims the
separator/padding right above that (`stripFooterChrome()`).

`TurnEngine` has a separate `externallyBusy` set alongside its normal turn
tracking, so these TUI commands are treated as "busy" the same way an
active turn is — this keeps the background watcher (section 5.5) from
trying to watch the same instance a TUI command is currently driving.

## 5.6.1 Switching mode (the four Shift+Tab modes)

`@cctag mode <name>` (`manual` / `accept-edits` / `plan` / `auto`) works
differently from switching model. These four modes have **no slash
command** — the only way to change them in Claude Code is cycling with
Shift+Tab. And herdr's `pane send-keys shift+tab`, though accepted,
**delivers nothing Claude Code reacts to**. Empirically, sending the raw
CSI Z sequence (`\x1b[Z`, backtab) via `pane send-text` does work — exposed
as `HerdrClient.paneSendText()`.

`runModeCommand()` matches the mode with a closed loop: read the current
mode off the footer status line (`⏸ manual mode on` / `⏵⏵ accept edits on` /
`⏸ plan mode on` / `⏵⏵ auto mode on`), and while it differs from the target,
send one CSI Z and re-read — repeating until it matches. Because it checks
after each press rather than computing a press count up front, it's robust
to the ring order or footer wording changing across versions. Two
safeguards: (1) if the current mode can't be read, it refuses to cycle
(there'd be no way to know where it landed), and (2) it presses at most one
full ring, so an unavailable target leaves the mode back where it started
rather than somewhere unpredictable. `@cctag plan` is shorthand for `mode
plan`.

## 5.6.2 Plan Mode over Slack

When a plan-mode turn finishes, Claude Code shows a "Here is Claude's plan /
ready to execute?" approval prompt (a kind of permission menu). On detecting
it, cctag:

- **attaches the full plan as a `.md` file**. The plan is written to
  `~/.claude/plans/<slug>.md`, and its path shows in the footer — but a
  narrow pane wraps and truncates that path, so the parsed path is only a
  hint: if it doesn't resolve to an existing file, cctag falls back to the
  **most-recently-modified file** in the plans directory (which Claude Code
  writes right before the prompt) — see `resolvePlanFile()`;
- posts **approval buttons** (proceed / proceed with auto mode);
- lets you **reply with changes in the thread**. The approval menu has a
  "Tell Claude what to change" free-text option; a plain thread reply is fed
  into it (move the cursor to that option's number, type the feedback,
  Enter), which regenerates the plan and stays in plan mode — so you can
  refine the plan from Slack before any code runs (`answerPlanFeedback()`).

Whether a prompt is a plan-approval prompt is decided by scanning only the
**active prompt region** — from the bottom-most cursor line down — for the
"Tell Claude what to change" marker. That way it (1) doesn't miss the option
when a narrow pane wraps an earlier option's label and cuts
`parsePermissionMenu`'s consecutive-number scan short, and (2) doesn't
misfire on the same line left in scrollback by an earlier, already-resolved
plan prompt (which sits above the current cursor). The "Tell Claude what to
change" option itself isn't rendered as a button — pressing its number only
moves the cursor without confirming, so changes are taken via free-text
reply instead.

## 5.7 Catching up on messages cctag wasn't mentioned in

cctag normally only ever sees the literal text of a message that mentions
it. A review posted by another Slack bot (like `@Claude`) or a teammate
elsewhere in the same thread is otherwise invisible to it unless someone
manually copies it into an `@cctag` message.

`@cctag log [instruction]` closes that gap. Rather than guessing intent
from wording, it looks up the thread's actual history via Slack's
`conversations.replies` API, mechanically finds **cctag's own last
message** in that thread, and takes everything posted after it. Each
message is formatted as `sender: text` (human display names resolved via
`users.info`, bot names via `bot_profile.name`/`username`), then fed into
the paired session as one turn — reusing `startTurn()` unchanged, so any
permission prompt or AskUserQuestion that comes up mid-turn is handled by
the same existing machinery. With no instruction, it defaults to "act on
whatever the log contains"; with one, that instruction is appended
instead. If nothing's been posted since cctag's last message, it says so
rather than starting a no-op turn.

`Notifier` gains an optional `getThreadHistorySinceLastBotPost?`, mirroring
`getPermalink?`'s design: `SlackNotifier` implements it directly for
standalone mode, while Hub–Spoke mode proxies it through a `get_thread_history`
RPC call the Hub executes (since the Hub is the side holding the real Slack
client there). The actual formatting logic
(`formatThreadHistorySinceLastBotPost`) lives once in `slack/notifier.ts`
and is shared by both paths.

## 5.8 How file attachments work (Slack ⇄ agent)

### Inbound: why handing over a path is enough

An image pasted into Slack arrives in the message's `files[]`, never in its
`text`. cctag downloads it to `~/.cctag/inbox/<file_id>-<name>` and simply
appends the paths to the prompt, one per line
(`buildPromptWithAttachments()`).

That works because **Claude Code converts an image path in a prompt into a real
image attachment.** Measured behavior:

- the path text is removed and replaced by an `[Image #N]` placeholder (which
  moves to the front of the text)
- the bytes land in the transcript as a separate base64 `image` block
- one extra record is appended noting `[Image: source: <path>]`
- the `Read` tool is never called — no extra tool round trip
- a path outside the cwd triggers no permission prompt, precisely because
  `Read` isn't involved
- paths containing spaces and non-ASCII (`スクリーンショット 2026-07-27
  14.02.33.png`) work unquoted

Base64-in-the-prompt was rejected on token grounds. Measured on a 2.8MB PNG:
~3.6k tokens this way (Claude Code re-encodes it to JPEG and downscales first)
versus ~170k as text — ~50x — and the text version isn't an image to the model
at all.

Non-image files (PDF, CSV, ...) stay plain paths for the agent to open with its
own `Read` tool.

### The inbound catch: an image path swallows the Enter

`herdr agent prompt` sequences the text injection and the Enter server-side, but
**a prompt carrying an image path doesn't submit — it sits in the input box.**
The path→attachment conversion is asynchronous and the Enter is absorbed while
it runs. A prompt with only non-image paths submits immediately, so this is
specific to images (measured: 500ms–1000ms to convert a 2.8MB PNG).

The existing "resend Enter if nothing was submitted" safety net (`0d4c830` /
`624389c`) waited once and retried once, so it's now a bounded loop of
`SUBMIT_RETRIES_WITH_IMAGES` attempts. An Enter into an empty box is a harmless
no-op, which is why erring toward over-retrying is the safe direction.

### Outbound: two routes

`Notifier.uploadFile?` (bytes as base64) sits alongside the `uploadTextFile?`
used for plan attachments, with the same shape: standalone goes straight through
`SlackNotifier`, Hub–Spoke goes through an `upload_file` RPC the Hub executes.
What gets sent is decided by two routes:

- **`<cwd>/.cctag/outbox/`** — the directory is snapshotted at turn start
  (name → `mtime:size`) and anything new or changed at turn end is uploaded.
  Per-cwd rather than global because several threads can be paired to different
  panes at once, and a shared outbox would post one pane's files into another
  pane's thread. Uploaded files are left in place — consuming a directory the
  user also writes to is hard to undo — and the mtime/size comparison keeps an
  untouched file from being re-sent.

  Per-cwd still leaves an ambiguity when **two panes share one cwd**. So
  whenever the outbox has additions, cctag asks `herdr agent list` for every
  pane's live cwd and checks whether another pairing points at the same one. If
  one does — or if the listing can't be fetched — it skips the outbox, says why
  in the thread, and leaves the files alone. Transcript detection is unaffected:
  those paths come from this turn's own transcript.
- **Transcript detection** — `SendUserFile`'s `input.files`. The agent stating
  outright that it wants a file delivered, so nothing is filtered by type, and
  its `caption` becomes the upload comment. Paths come from `input.files`,
  resolved against the pane's cwd (`tool_result` carries absolute paths but in
  an undocumented human-readable format, so it is used only for its success bit).

  This replaced detecting `Write` `file_path`s narrowed to images/SVG/PDF, which
  inferred "send this" from "a file changed": it posted artifacts nobody asked
  for, needed an extension allowlist that dropped legitimate `.csv` and `.md`
  files, and still missed the common case, since files produced by Bash (a
  matplotlib PNG) leave no recoverable path in the transcript. Codex CLI has no
  equivalent tool, so the outbox stays its only route.

  Crucially, **the `tool_use` alone must not be trusted.** A request and its
  result are separate records that routinely arrive in different poll batches,
  and a denied call changes nothing — acting on the request alone would have
  cctag read and upload a file the human just refused to release (measured: a
  denial records `is_error: true` on the `tool_result`). `WrittenFileTracker`
  therefore correlates request and result by `tool_use_id` and only surfaces
  **confirmed** calls.

### Hub–Spoke file flow and authorization

A Spoke holds no bot token, so the Hub always performs the download. The Hub
forwards the file metadata it saw on the event *and* records **which file id it
offered to which owner** (`fileOwner`, capped at 500), and the `fetch_file` RPC
serves only ids in that record for that owner. Without it, a Spoke could name
any file id and pull down anything the bot can see. The download URL itself is
never handed to the Spoke; the Hub re-resolves it from Slack.

A transfer moves megabytes of base64 in one JSON message and includes a Slack
API round trip, which the RPC's 20s default (sized for `chat.postMessage`)
doesn't cover — file calls use 120s instead. The caps
(`CCTAG_MAX_FILE_MB` / `CCTAG_MAX_FILE_COUNT`) are enforced on both the Spoke
and the Hub.

Because **Hub and Spoke ship independently**, a Hub that predates `upload_file`
answers `no handler for ...`. That's reported to the thread once as "the Hub
needs updating" rather than as a transfer failure (`isUnsupportedByRemote()`).

## 6. Connecting one PC to more than one Slack workspace

A Hub is tied to exactly one workspace (by its Slack app token). To reach a
second workspace, you run a second Hub (it can live on the same server)
and a second Spoke on your own PC.

In that case, **both Spokes are looking at the same herdr daemon**, so a
terminal paired in one workspace also shows up in the other workspace's
`connect` picker. Avoid pairing the same terminal from both at once — the
keystrokes would collide.

## 7. Security notes

- Anyone who can post in a paired thread can send text into a
  full-permission local agent. Only pair threads in channels with people
  you trust
- Permission prompts (e.g. confirming a dangerous command) still require a
  human's approval via Slack buttons — nothing runs unattended
- A Hub token (`token issue <name> <ownerUserId>`) is bound to the Slack
  user ID it was issued for and can't register as anyone else — but it can
  still act on that owner's own paired threads, so only hand tokens to
  people you trust
