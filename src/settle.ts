/**
 * Whether the agent has finished its turn, decided from the agent's own
 * transcript rather than from herdr's `agent_status`.
 *
 * herdr's status is not a reliable "is the agent still answering?" signal. It
 * comes from prioritized detection rules evaluated against the pane, and a
 * lingering background shell trips one that outranks every idle rule: measured
 * on herdr 0.8.2 (detection manifest 2026.08.21.1), a pane whose agent was
 * plainly idle — empty prompt box, idle title glyph — reported `working`
 * indefinitely because `background_shell_working` (priority 965) beat
 * `live_prompt_box` (950) and `osc_title_idle` (250). `state_change_seq` never
 * moved. Both places that waited for `idle`/`done` therefore waited forever:
 * TurnEngine's poll loop burned its full timeout and reported one, and
 * BackgroundWatcher never posted output it had already collected.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT keyed on herdr's rule ids. Those ship in a remotely-updated
 * manifest and can be renamed or reprioritized without a herdr release, and the
 * offending rule is one of a family (background shells, background agents, MCP
 * tasks) — matching on them would be a fix with an expiry date.
 *
 * The transcript is the agent's own record of its work, so it is the thing that
 * actually knows. See the drivers' lifecycle extraction for what marks a
 * boundary in each format.
