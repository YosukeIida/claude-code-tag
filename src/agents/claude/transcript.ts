/**
 * Turn boundaries in a Claude Code transcript.
 *
 * The authoritative end-of-turn record is `{type: "system", subtype:
 * "turn_duration"}`, which the CLI writes once per completed turn as that
 * turn's last record — measured across 286 local transcripts (366 occurrences,
 * carrying `durationMs`). It is preferred because it reports that *the harness*
 * finished, not merely that one API response ended.
 *
 * `stop_reason` is kept as a fallback for transcripts written before
 * `turn_duration` existed. It is a sound boundary but not a one-per-turn one: a
 * single API response is split into one record per content block and every
 * block carries the response's `stop_reason`, so a reply with a thinking block
 * and a text block yields two `end_turn` records (measured: 508 `end_turn`
 * against 366 `turn_duration` in the same sample). That is harmless here —
 * SettleTracker only needs to know a boundary was crossed, and crossing it
 * twice reads the same as once. What matters is that it never fires *mid*-turn:
 * a text block emitted alongside tool calls is stamped `tool_use`, not
 * `end_turn`, because the stamp belongs to the response rather than the block.
 *
 * A start is a genuine user record — content that is a plain string, or blocks
 * with no `tool_result` among them. Tool results come back as `user` records
 * too, and treating those as starts would re-arm the tracker on every tool call
 * in the turn. Claude's single-text-block interrupt marker is instead an
 * `aborted` boundary.
 *
 * Sidechain records (subagent transcripts) are skipped: their turns are not the
 * pane's turn, and letting them arm or settle the tracker would report a
 * subagent's completion as the pane's.
